# CogentCodingChallenge
This Console based application written in C# (.Net Core) can be used to find duplicates in a given root path. One of the applications of this application is when a client merged their home photo folder with their partner's folder, with disastrous consequences as they now have a lot of duplicate photos in different places in the folder structure.
My application can search based on different options including file name, the last time file has been changed, teh actual content of the files, and the file size. You may want to use a combination of options to narrow down your search.
When running the application it asks you to enter the search mode which is explanied above and then enter the full path of the directory you want to search. It will show the results case by case and if the number of duplicate files are more than the screen size (in terms of lines) it has an abilitiy to show it page by page.
User can quit at any time by entering the right commands.
